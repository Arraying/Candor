# Installation & Documentation

Almost all documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Arraying/Candor/wiki). If something is not covered in the wiki, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Arraying/Candor/issues/new) with your question.

# Roadmap

The current development roadmap is as follows:
- [‚≠ê] Quality of life improvements to the config editor.
- [üêô] A GitHub status integration.
- [üíæ] The ability to use state of previous pipelines as base images.
- [üîå] A plugin system such that common pipeline steps such as Git clones can be abbreviated.
- [üîß] A fully-fledged web dashboard replacing the CLI.
- [üì°] Updates and logs in real time.

Please note that this roadmap will most likely change as priorities shift or new ideas arise.

# Contributing

Contributors are awesome!
Many contribution types are accepted, from feature implementations to bug bug reports/fixes, or even discussing the state of the codebase.

## Contribution Flow

1. All contributions should start off as an issue.
Then, if necessary, the proposed contribution will be discussed.
2. For code contributions, please fork the project's `main` branch, since this is where everything comes together.
3. If your contributions are testable within reason (the final judgement of this is up to the maintainers), please write or edit some tests.
All tests must pass before the contribution can be accepted, and there must not be any linter errors or warnings.
4. If applicable, create a pull-request, where your contribution will be reviewed.
5. Propose any changes to documentation in the wiki or even pull-request itself. 
6. Once the pull-request or change is accepted, the issue will be closed, and you are officially a contributor!

## Further Notes

When contributing, please keep the following in mind:
- Bug reports should be descriptive and reproducible, the more information the better (including version)!
- Follow the preexisting coding style of the project.
Indent using spaces, not tabs.
- Embrace documentation! 
Not only will users be able to understand how to use the software, it also explains it to other developers and yourself later down the road.
- By contributing code, you agree to release your code under the same license as the project.
